    <h3>Aim of the project</h3>
    </h3>
    <p>The aim of the project is to create a system that can automatically
    create a machine learning model for a given dataset. The system will
    automatically select the best model for the dataset and will also
    compare the accuracies of models and will select the best model for
    the dataset.</p>

    <p>But before training the model there are several
        tasks that we need to perform on the dataset.
        <ul>
            <li>Importing the dataset</li>
            <li>Checking for null values</li>
            <li>Checking for categorical values</li>
            <li>Checking for outliers</li>
            <li>Checking for skewness</li>
            <li>Checking for correlation</li>
            <li>Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets</li>
            <li>Scaling the dataset</li>

        </ul>

        First we will automate these tasks then we will proceed
        further and complete those ones also.<br>

        After the project is done we will call it as the
        <!--Hower over that to see the effect-->
        <abbr title = "Automatic Machine Learning System">
            AMLS</abbr>
    </p>

        After the completion of the project. I will present this project in our UG Computer
        Science Club named Databased, and this project will also be uploaded in Databased
        website along with other projects on which my teammates will work.

        You are also invited to attend my presentation here :- 
        <address>
            Computer Science And Automation Department<br>
            Indian Institute of Science<br>
            Bengaluru - 560012<br>
        </address>
    </p>

    <p>
        After all the presentations are over, Lunch will be served in department and 
        a campus tour will be given to students where these places will be shown to
        them :-
        <ol>
            <li>Library</li>
            <li>Hostels</li>
